  <h2 style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>SanQi, the World Traveler!</strong></h2>
  <p>Born in Taipei, he embarked on a transcontinental journey to the U.S. at just two months old. The very next day, he set off to the Great Smoky Mountains to witness the magical fall colors. </p>

  <div style="text-align: center; width: 50%; margin-right: 10px;">
    <h2 style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Stubborn but Adorable!</strong></h2>
    <p>Oh, he can be quite stubborn too. With a mind of his own, he often charts his own paths and may even pretend not to listen to you.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>A Dog Who Loves Learning?</strong></h2>
    <p>SanQi even attended "kinderdog" school to learn how to "sit", and get along with everyone. And guess what? He graduated with flying colors!</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>A Social Butterfly!</strong></h2>
    <p>One thing SanQi absolutely loves is meeting new friends—people, kids, dogs, insects—you name it! He smiles incessantly, although his breath might make you question that decision.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>His Gloomy Days...</strong></h2>
    <p>But beware, even SanQi has his gloomy days. There was this one time when he decided to take a nap with his eyes hidden under a drawer leg. I kid you not, it was both hilarious and adorable!</p>
